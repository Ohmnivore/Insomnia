Essentially this is a rudimentary Haxe wrapper around some system functions that handle processes. I was trying to make an online game where I needed a dedicated server to run 24/7. Of course that wouldn't work when the computer would fall asleep. That's why I decided to make this.

### Features:
* Set process priority
* Keep the computer/display from falling asleep

### Ex:
* Insomnia.setThreadExecutionState(ES_CONTINUOUS | ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED | ES_AWAYMODE_REQUIRED);
* Insomnia.setProcessPriority(Insomnia.P_REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS);
Open up src/Main.hx for a full example or run bin/Main.exe to see the example in action.

### Notes:
Note that this is Windows-only for now. Use with native/Neko builds.
To use this library in your own project, grab src/insomnia/Insomnia.hx and bin/Insomnia.ndll. It's also possible that you may have to grab bin/libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll.

### TODO:
* Port to Linux
* Port to Android
* Port to Mac
